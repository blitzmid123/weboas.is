If you’re reading this, than its already too late. Life is a game that I can’t seem to win lately and I'm tired of losing. I know I'm not the first to feel this way. It's time for a new strategy. I just need to get away from this world forever. Clearly I’m not compatible. I'm sorry to my friends and family that will have to find me like this, but it's the only way forward. I’ve been at a low point in my life the past two months and don’t foresee it getting any better. In fact it seems to be spiraling out of control even more.

Also, don’t you dare blame this on guns. Someone determined to take their own life would find a way to do it one way or another.

Rest assured this is all taking place in my personal life and has nothing to do with WebOasis. I don’t keep IP logs and your data for the forum and chat will remain safe and encrypted until the server inevitably expires months from now at which point it will be wiped/destroyed. To quell any potential rumors, I want to repeat this is a personal matter and has nothing to do with the site or copyright mafia.

Thank you to the loyal users that made WebOasis great. I want to especially thank those that assisted me with posting content/links and making graphics for me. It helped immensely.

I’m a man of my word and will post the source code publicly. Maybe someone can continue my work. I’ll post everything except the forum and chat databases.

To the individual(s) in real life that are trying to ruin me, congratulations, you’ve won! You almost certainly won’t ever see this, but if you do…Now I no longer have to worry about you and you no longer have to worry about me. You’re welcome.

Goodbye <3 Webby
